      <p>Happy 3rd anniversary bebi! We've been together for a long time. We had our disagreements, our fights, but of course there's still our love and happy times. This has been a rough year for both of us. An adjustment time as it called. Kase from student to working phase na tayo ng buhay at separate na gawain on our own. But with this, I still thank you so much cause you beared a lot of things and still kept me kahit sobrang hirap ko na intindihin. Thank you so much for staying and not giving up on us, on me. Thank you for sacrificing your sanity for me, for all the things that you never did before, but you did anyway for me. I am really sorry I wasn't the best boyfriend you have experienced the past year. It was really tough for me but that should not be an excuse to treat you like that. There are still things that I am sorry for pero hindi na mababalik. At sorry dahil sobrang nasira kita. This time, babawi ako, I will help you as you helped me, I will always be there for you as you were with me. I promise, I wont make you feel that I will be leaving you again. I love you so much that I have realized a lot of things within the few months. I cant let you go, for real. You are the love of my life, and I dont want you to be the loss of my life. Stay strong to both of us and we'll fight all things together, side by side, forever. I love you so much and happy anniversary again, my love! Let's enjoy our day. Mwaa</p>
